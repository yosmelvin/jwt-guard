## JWT-Guard

JWT-Guard is a Laravel package that allow authentication and authorization as a guard driver using JWT tokens.

This package was forked from paulvl/jwt-guard.

## **Quick Installation**

Begin by installing this package through Composer.

You can run:

    composer require yosmelvin/jwt-guard 0.*

Or edit your project's composer.json file to require yosmelvin/jwt-guard.
```
    "require": {
        "yosmelvin/jwt-guard": "0.*"
    }
```
Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

    composer update

Once the package's installation completes, the final step is to add the service provider. Open `config/app.php`, and add a new item to the providers array:

```
LucasRomano\JWTGuard\Auth\AuthServiceProvider::class,
```

Finally publish package's configuration file:

    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LucasRomano\JWTGuard\Auth\AuthServiceProvider"

Then the file `config/jwt.php` will be created.

## **JWT Guard**

### **JWT driver setup!**

To start using JWT drive you need to create anew guard on `config/auth.php` file:
```
...
'guards' => [
        ...
        'jwt' => [
            'driver' => 'jwt',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        ...
    ],
...
```
You can use any `Eloquent` provider that you want.

###**Using JWT Guard**

####**attempt**

```
	// Assuming you retrieve your credentials from request
	$credentials = [
		'email' => 'test@example.com',
		'password' => 'password'
	];
	//this will return a token array
	return Auth::guard('jwt')->attempt($credentials);
```


####**blacklistToken**

```
	//this will blacklist current jwt-token and referenced refresh token if exists
	return Auth::guard('jwt')->blacklistToken();
```


###**Using JWT Middleware**

if you need to validate JWT token request just add `LucasRomano\JWTGuard\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateJwt::class` to `routeMiddleware` on `Http/Kernel.php` file:

```
protected $routeMiddleware = [
        ...
        'auth-jwt' => \LucasRomano\JWTGuard\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateJwt::class,
        ...
    ];
```
